      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>
        Like most website operators, EireVPN collects non-personally-identifying information of the
        sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
        language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
        EireVPN's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
        understand how EireVPN's visitors use its website. From time to time, EireVPN may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on
        trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>
      <p>
        EireVPN also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
        (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://eirevpn.ie blog
        posts. EireVPN only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described
        below.
      </p>
      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>
        Certain visitors to EireVPN's websites choose to interact with EireVPN in ways that require
        EireVPN to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
        that EireVPN gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors
        who sign up for a blog at https://eirevpn.ie to provide a username and email address.
      </p>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we
        strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>
      <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>
        EireVPN discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
        only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to
        know that information in order to process it on EireVPN's behalf or to provide services
        available at EireVPN's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some
        of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your
        home country; by using EireVPN's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to
        them. EireVPN will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and
        affiliated organizations, as described above, EireVPN discloses potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a
        subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when EireVPN believes in good faith
        that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of EireVPN, third
        parties or the public at large.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a registered user of https://eirevpn.ie and have supplied your email address,
        EireVPN may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your
        feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with EireVPN and our products. We
        primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this
        type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via
        one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
        clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. EireVPN takes all
        measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or
        destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
